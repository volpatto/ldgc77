# Locally Discontinuous but Globally Continuous Galerkin approximation by Finite Element Method written in Fortran 77.

This implementation is related to the one detailed in the paper [Locally discontinuous but globally continuous Galerkin methods for elliptic problems](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cma.2012.11.013) presented by Arruda, Loula and Almeida (2013).
